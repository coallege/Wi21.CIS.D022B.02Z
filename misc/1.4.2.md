# 1.4.2: Deallocating memory

Deallocate memory for kitchenPaint using the delete operator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class PaintContainer {
   public:
      ~PaintContainer();
      double gallonPaint;
};

PaintContainer::~PaintContainer() { // Covered in section on Destructors.
   cout << "PaintContainer deallocated." << endl;
}

int main() {
   PaintContainer* kitchenPaint;

   kitchenPaint = new PaintContainer;
   kitchenPaint->gallonPaint = 26.3;
	// your solution here
   cout << "PaintContainer deallocated.\n";

   return 0;
}
```
